# Node.js Authentication and Authorization with Express.js, MongoDB, JWT, and Cookies

This project is a Node.js backend application built with Express.js and MongoDB to demonstrate authentication and authorization functionality using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and cookies. It includes authentication features for users (students) and administrators, allowing access to different parts of the application based on user roles.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for authentication.
- **Role-based Authorization**: The application differentiates between student and admin roles, allowing access to different endpoints and functionalities based on the user's role.
- **Token-based Authentication**: JWT tokens are generated upon successful login and stored in cookies for subsequent authenticated requests.
- **Secure Password Storage**: User passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the MongoDB database.
- **RESTful API**: The backend provides a RESTful API for user authentication and authorization operations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and provide the following environment variables:

    ```plaintext
    PORT=3000
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
    JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
    ```

4. Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

- **Sign Up**: Users can sign up by providing their name, email, password, and role (student or admin).
- **Log In**: Users can log in with their email and password to access authenticated routes.
- **Access Control**: Certain routes and functionalities are restricted based on the user's role.
- **Log Out**: Users can log out to invalidate their JWT token and clear the session cookie.

## API Endpoints

- **POST /api/v1/signup**: Register a new user.
- **POST /api/v1/login**: Log in and generate JWT token.
- **GET /api/v1/student**: student autherization.
 - **GET /api/v1/admin**: admin autherization.
- *(Add more endpoints if necessary)*
